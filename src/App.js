        To build this website, i used react.js because its easy to intergrate witihin vs code and to deploy the website. 
        The process was quite simple, by running a couple terminal commands i was able to create a directory and start working on my 
        react.js website.
        The only difficulties i ran into was launching the application using digitalocean.com, the interface was a little confusing at first
        but after some trouble shooting i was able to delpoy my website.

      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
